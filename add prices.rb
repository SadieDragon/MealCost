#ask the user to input [(the store), (the item), (the package size (ie 12 oz)), and (the cost of the item)]

#break that input into an array based on commas (as shown above in the comment)
#make sure that the stores modified are stored in an array

#read in the JSON of stuffz for each store
#add to the hash that corresponds with the store tag -> if a new store is detected, abort and ask them to add a new store and acronyms to the program

#if an item is already in the price list, prompt the user with the old price, and the price change

#do you have more to add to that store? 
#yes -> how many more items? -> repeat the above x times, minus the store tag -> no condition
#no -> do you have another store to add to? -> (yes -> repeat all of the above steps) (no -> next step)

#update the JSON for the stores that were updated
